## üé® Customization

### Colors and Theme
The app uses a purple gradient theme. You can customize colors by editing the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #6366f1;
  --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
  --background-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  --glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}
```

### Adding Categories
To add new task categories, edit the select options in `index.html` and update the CSS styles accordingly.

### Modifying Icons
Replace the icon files in the `icons/` directory with your own designs. Make sure to maintain the same file names and sizes. Use the included icon generation tools for creating new icon sets.

### Electron Configuration
Modify `package.json` to customize the Electron build:
- Change app name and description
- Adjust window size and properties
- Configure build targets and options
- **Menu Bar**: The default menu bar is removed for a cleaner look. To restore it, remove or comment out `mainWindow.removeMenu();` in `main.js`.

## üîß Development

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. For PWA testing, serve files with a local server

### Building
- **Electron**: `npm run build`
- **PWA**: Deploy files to a web server
- **Icons**: Use the included icon generation tools

### Build Output
After successful build, you'll find:
- **Directory**: `dist/EruFlow-win32-x64/` (folder with executable)
- **Unpacked**: `dist/win-unpacked/` (development version)

### Debugging
- Electron: Use `mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools()` in `main.js`
- PWA: Use browser developer tools
- Check browser console for error messages

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Issues
- **Electron app not starting**: Ensure Node.js is installed and dependencies are installed
- **PWA install button not appearing**: Make sure you're using a supported browser (Chrome/Edge)
- **App not installing**: Check that the manifest.json file is accessible
- **Offline not working**: Ensure the service worker is properly registered

#### Build Issues
- **Permission denied**: Run as Administrator or use portable build
- **Missing author field**: Ensure package.json has an author field
- **Cache corruption**: Clear electron-builder cache manually
- **Build fails**: Try clean reinstall

#### Data Issues
- **Tasks not saving**: Check that localStorage is enabled in your browser
- **Data lost**: Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage
- **Repeated tasks not showing**: Verify the repetition logic and date calculations

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow loading**: Clear browser cache and reload
- **Animations lagging**: Check your device's performance settings
- **Electron app slow**: Check system resources and close unnecessary applications

### Quick Fixes

#### Windows Build Issues
```powershell
# Clean install
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm install
npm run build
```

#### Cache Issues
```powershell
# Clear electron-builder cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\electron-builder\Cache" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
npm run build
```
